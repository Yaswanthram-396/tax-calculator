#tax-calculator For this project i considered only the financial year of 2022 -2023. In this project i calculated only the employee salary and i didn't consider any other taxes. I reduced Rs.50000 from intial salary as a rebate given by the government of a india. I aslo removed 2.5Lakh from the intial amount ,as tax is not aplicable for the income lessthan or equal to 2.5Lakh And i calculated the Tax for 2.5 Lakh in 1st slab. Because the differnce in each slab is 2.5Lakh And i Subracted 2.5 Lakh in second salb because for 2.5Lakh tax is calculated on the previous slab, And i calculated the Tax for 2.5 Lakh for the 2nd slab and i added the previous slab for this slab,Because to calculate the Total Tax. Like this i claculated and added up the slabs based up on the salary of the employee. you can check my project by this link: https://onecompiler.com/python/3zspx6qba
